## Creating class hierarchy

- **Extended class hierarchy**: Created superclass `Engine` with subclasses `CombustionEngine`, `ElectricEngine` and `HybridEngine`.

- **Created `Manufacture` class**: class with all setters and getters.

- **`Vehicle` hierarchy**: Created an abstract superclass `Vehicle` with method `ShowCharacteristics()` and subclasses `ICEV`, `BEV` and `HybridV`.

- **Demonstrated result**: Created an array of `Vehicle` objects and used the `ShowCharacteristics()` method.
